    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a long time dnd player turned dm. I have played dnd for 6 years and have been a dm for the past 4 years.
    <p>I became a dm because I grew tired of how limiting the base game is and felt that I could improve upon it with new homebrew spells, abilites, classes, and much more.</p>

    <h2>About the Game</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>My game will take place on <a href="https://roll20.net/">Roll20.</a></li>
        <li>We will be using <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> for the voice chat function and general information.</li>
        <li>My game is a heavily homebrewed world with homebrew rules, if that is not something that interests you than I can't recomend playing in this game.</li>
        <li>My game is narative based, therefor I expect you to interact with the world through your character, now I will be doing my best to engage you in the world but that is a two way street.</li>
        <li>My game goes to at least level 20 and sometimes to level 25, so with that in mind, late game will get mechanically complex.</li>
        <li>My goal is to make sure you are having fun, but I will not sacrifice everyone else's fun for the sake of one person as this is a team game.</li>
    </ul>
